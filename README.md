# AutomatePcapAnalysis

The program will run as a scheduled task, grab traffic, and then print output about
who has connections into your system.

This program is not completely done, but I don't have time to make it extra fancy. The core components of the program work and it's pretty fun to play with. 

# Update

I tries to upload the csv I used to create the geo location database and the database file, but both files are too large. It looks like this program is for personal use only. 

# INFORMATION:

Use the commands in the shell script to figure out how to capture traffic using tshark. This program was specifically written to deal w/ a specific style of data that is output by tshark.
